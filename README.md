Flask is a Python framework for building lightweight and dynamic web applications. It helps speed up tedious behind-the-scenes development work, such as URL mapping, and offers more control than its closest competitor, Django. If you want to learn Flask, this course provides the training and hands-on examples you need to get started quickly. Join instructor Nick Walter as he covers the pros and cons of working with Flask, and steps through how to create your first app with the framework. Nick covers data flow in Flask; working with templates using Jinja, the template engine in Flask; using blueprints and views for organization; testing your Flask app; and deploying your project with Gunicorn.
